        <p>I graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor's degree in Accounting from Ball State University in May 2021.
          I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Statistics degree at Ball State University and graduate in May 2023.
          I’m seeking a role in data science upon graduation where I can leverage statistics and coding to gain insights from data.</p>
        <p>Currently, I’m a graduate assistant in the Department of Economics at Ball State and I’m working on my master’s thesis.
          As a GA, I have experience tutoring and leading study sessions for business statistics and econometrics.
          I also used Python to automate the creation of an analytic report of student video viewership habits.
          My thesis extends the prior literature on survival neural networks to parametric models.
          The impetus behind using neural networks is to accommodate interaction and higher order terms, as well as non-linearity, into the relationship between the response and covariates.
          Traditional models require extensive feature engineering and domain knowledge to learn these relationships, where a neural network will learn on its own.</p>
        <p>I am drawn towards statistics because it allows us to gain knowledge about the unknown in a systematic way and test our assumptions with the evidence at hand.
          I am also excited about coding and making life simpler (mine and others) through automation.
          Finally, I have a love for learning and strive to better myself everyday.
          On a weekly basis I expand my data science toolkit through a variety of DataCamp courses, including topics on SQL and web scraping.
          I also build upon my knowledge as a coder through Udemy's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023."</p>

          <li>I enjoy <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115278022-samuel-kinghorn" target="_blank">reading</a> classical literature and some of my favorites are <em>Dracula</em>, <em>1984</em>, and <em>Crime and Punishment</em>.
            I also have an interest in philosophy, particularly ethics and how to live a good life. The book I'm currently reading is <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>.</li>
          <li>My love for music prompted me to pick up guitar where I'm currently mastering barre chords.</li>
