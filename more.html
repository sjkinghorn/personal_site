        <p>I graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor's in Accounting from Ball State University in May 2021.
          In May 2023, I'll graduate with a Master’s in Statistics from Ball State University.
          I'm seeking opportunities in data and analytics where I can leverage statistics and programming to gain insights from data.</p>
        <p>Currently, I’m completing my master’s thesis while working as a graduate assistant in the Department of Economics at Ball State.
          As a GA, I have experience tutoring and leading study sessions for business statistics and econometrics.
          I also used Python to automate the creation of an analytic report of student video viewership habits to identify struggling students and drive engagement.
          My thesis extends the prior literature on survival neural networks to parametric models.
          The impetus behind using neural networks is to accommodate interaction and higher order terms, as well as non-linearity, into the relationship between the response and covariates.
          Traditional models require extensive feature engineering and domain knowledge to learn these relationships, where a neural network will learn on its own.</p>
        <p>I'm drawn to statistics because it allows us to gain knowledge about the unknown in a systematic way and test our assumptions with the evidence at hand.
          I also have a passion for learning and strive to improve myself everyday.
          In the world of data and analytics, independent learning is essential.
          I've taught myself a variety of skills and subjects, ranging from SQL and web scraping to discrete mathematics.
          On a weekly basis, I expand my technical skillset through various DataCamp courses and enhance my knowledge of programming through Udemy's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023."
          Consequently, I have become adept at learning and assimilating new ideas efficiently.</p>

          <li>I enjoy <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115278022-samuel-kinghorn" target="_blank">reading</a> classic literature and some of my favorites are <em>Dracula</em>, <em>1984</em>, and <em>Crime and Punishment</em>.
            I also have an interest in philosophy, particularly ethics and how to live a good life. The book I'm currently reading is <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>.</li>
          <li>My love for music prompted me to learn how to play the guitar where I'm currently mastering barre chords.</li>
